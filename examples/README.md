# Examples

When working with an PLC SDK, it may be challenging to work with the SDK if you don't have a physical Siemens PLC available. Thanks to many open source projects, are there countless ways of running a Virtualized PLC or a specialized embedded software on a raspberry pi.

- See [Docker](./docker/README.md) for running the Rust7 SDK against a S7-PLC in Docker. 
- See [SDK](./sdk/README.md) for learning more with practical examples, that shows how to use the Rust7 SDK in a practical way.
- See [Diagnostics](./diagnostics/README.md) for reading SZL / diagnostic buffer data from a PLC (`read_cpu_info`, `read_szl`, `read_diagnostic_buffer`).
